    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="pretzels-ingredients">
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1 package instant yeast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="pretzels-steps">
        <li>Make the Dough: In a mixing bowl, gently whisk the warm milk, yeast, brown sugar, butter, and salt. Stir in the flour until a dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead 10-15 times.</li>
        <li>Let the Dough Hang Out: Return to the bowl and drizzle with a little oil to prevent sticking. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and set aside for an hour to rise.</li>
        <li>Pretzel-ify: When the dough has risen, punch it back down and divide it into 6-8 sections. Roll each section into a loooong skinny rope. Fold it into a pretzel. Dip into the baking soda solution and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake: Brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with salt. Bake at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown. YUUUUUM! Dip in cheese sauce, mustard, or my personal favorite beer cheese soup.</li>
    </ol>
